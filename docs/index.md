## Summary 

Co-founded  TYBR Design, to create and sell 3D printed items in June of 2020. Sold over 1300 items in the first 6 months of launching the online store. This experience taught me that customers value quality, customer service, and timely fulfillment of their orders; qualities that helped set us apart from other online stores selling similar products. 


I am seeking a job that will allow me to continue to develop my skills and can help me earn money while away from home and not able to run the business.

## Skills

__Organization__
While running TYBR design I had to learn ways to keep our product inventory neat and organized so that when we received an 
order it could be fulfilled efficiently while also not taking up too much room.

__Customer Service__
I would often have to deal with unhappy customers, who either did not like their product or were having issues with the postal service. I had to work with not only the customers, but I also had to work with the postal service many times.

__3D Modeling__
Many of the products I sell on TYBR Design were created by me as I developed my skills as a 3d modeler. I know many skills for 3D file editing and also creating new files from scratch. I have experience using Meshmixer, Cura, Preform, Fusion 360 and Blender.

__Excel__
I have taken a course on Excel and have also been able to apply that to TYBR design as I made a spreadsheet that would tell us the cost of production for  each object and what the price needed to be to earn a certain profit margin.

__Web Development__
I have created websites using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Javascript based on Figma mock-ups made by graphic designers using Github to colobrate with team memebers working on the project and weekly meetings with supervisors.

__Computer Programming__
I also know computer programming in the languages Python, PHP, and SQL. I have taken multiple classes on them throughout high school and now college and I have been able to work at a software development company for a time

__Data Science Programming__
I am famaliar with many data science and machine learning python libraries such as Pandas, Altair, Numpy, Matplotlib, and SciKit-Learn along with R-Studio and MYSQL Oracle and Workbench

__Leadership__
I have learned how to organize large group projects and make sure that the people I am in charge of are completing their tasks the way they should, and I have also had to learn how to motivate people when they are not doing the things they need to be, and that each person needs to be motivated in different ways. As a section leader for a band of almost 500 people in Texas and as an Eagle Scout

__Teaching__ 
I learned how to effectively teach and guide people as they strive to learn new skills and become better skilled in the area they are growing in. I learned this by teaching employees how to run different aspects of Tybr Design while I am gone and teaching fellow missionaries and others while on my mission for my church.
